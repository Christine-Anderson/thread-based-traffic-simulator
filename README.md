## Thread Based Traffic Simulator

### Overview
<p>The Thread Based Traffic Simulator models the interaction of threads (represented as cars) sharing a common resource (the road) using multithreading. This simulator uses thread synchronization techniques to manage traffic and compares thread scheduling strategies by collecting statistics on
car wait times and road occupancy levels. It utilizes the Pixel Game Engine for graphical visualization of the traffic simulation and statistics.<p>
